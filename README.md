# Architecture
## The structure of the website uses Express HTML to integrate with the backend. JavaScript was used to enable user input and interactions and to make API requests to the websiteâ€™s backend. The SPA uses the Angular framework where different features and services of the SPA are stored in their own individual components. The backend uses a NoSQL database due to its scalability and ability to adapt to the application during its development.

# Functionality
## JSON differs from JavaScript by the way it is used to format and transmit data. The type of data varies such as strings, numbers, Booleans, and arrays. JSON and JavaScript tie together the frontend and backend development pieces by allowing the backend to communicate with the website by interchanging the data through APIs. The SPA uses reusable user interface components such as the trip card components, the navigation bar, the login component and features such as adding or editing a trip. This ensures the application code is technically sound by allowing for efficiency, maintainability, and scalability.

# Testing
## In a full stack application, there are methods to interact with data from a server such as GET, POST, PUT, AND ELETE. The methods use endpoints such as URLs which route between the server and the website. For example, to retrieve or create a new user, the GET and POST method would use the /api/users/ endpoint. To update a user, the PUT method would use the /api/users/:id endpoint. The endpoints are secured with the help of JSON Web tokes by validating the user.

# Reflection
## This course has helped me get more hands-on experiences in full-stack development and more specifically more insights on the back end processes. It has improved my understanding on RESTful APIs and how they operates and interchange data with the frontend. By building the scalable and secure Travlr website, I have developed skills that will help me become more marketable in the cloud computing field. Scalability and security are crucial skills to have when designing cloud-based architectures.
