## Architecture
# The structure of the website uses Express HTML to integrate with the backend. JavaScript was used to enable user input and interactions and to make API requests to the websiteâ€™s backend. The SPA uses the Angular framework where different features and services of the SPA are stored in their own individual components. The backend uses a NoSQL database due to its scalability and ability to adapt to the application during its development.
